Readme test update

## Description:

App that catalogs group home placements and allows hospital social workers 
to comment on placements with additional info (who they serve, good/bad 
experiences, additional contact info or special instructions for referrals).

Similar applications exist but are largely not kept up to date, or are for 
specific populations (elderly, IDD, independent housing).

Next steps:
    - Finish admin/user setup, add user profile/edit pages for SWs,
    include display name
    - Create open home page with info about what the app is for,
    gmail address for licensees/referral contacts to send info/updates
    - HTML page with info about placement/license types, general statutes
    - Continue adding remaining placements from all of NC; gem to add excel 
    spreadsheet file: roo
        - Need to incorporate data from multiple sources (word docs) and clean
    - Add other types of placments; family care homes, adult care homes, 
    assisted living faclities, IDD group homes, substance abuse facilities
    - Improve search; add tables and associations for counties/hospitals/MCO 
    catchment areas, filter options for special factors
    
Future considerations:
    - Map results, local resources
    - Scalability; addition of other types of adult homes, child placements,
    day activity facilities, partial hospitalization programs
    - Add Medicaid service/provider info including ability to search by 
    Medicaid plan type, MCO contract and county
    - Adding functionality for licensees to be able to "own" and edit their 
    placements, add photos, mark their facility as accepting referrals or not
