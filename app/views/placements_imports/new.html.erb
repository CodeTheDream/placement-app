<h3>Import from Excel</h3>

<p>
Reminder: The application will read your spreadsheet and attempt to find the 
object by its ID, then update the record (if the ID exists) or create a new 
record (if the ID does not exist yet). 
</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Do not change existing IDs. Add new IDs in chronological order.</li>
  <li>Only import spreadsheets that were previously downloaded from this 
  application; others cannot be read correctly.</li>
  <li>Always import licensees before importing placements.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Select File</h5>
<%= form_for @placements_import do |f| %>
  <% if @placements_import.errors.any? %>
    <%= pluralize(@placements_import.errors.count, "error") %> prevented us from
    importing your spreadsheet. Please update your spreadsheet and try again.
    <ul>
      <% @placements_import.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
        <li><%= msg %></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
  <% end %>

  <%= f.file_field :file %>
  <%= f.submit "Import File" %>
<% end %>
