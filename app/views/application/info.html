    <h4 class='text-info'>Purpose</h4>

        <p>
        The Home Page is a browser-based web application for CRH social workers 
        to find and exchange information about licensed facilities in North 
        Carolina. The purpose of the project is to improve the quality of 
        information available to social workers, so we can spend less time 
        searching for options and more time working with our patients. This 
        will hopefully result in patients spending less time waiting for placement 
        to be found, and being matched with placements that are a good fit.

    <h4 class='text-info'>How will this help me find placements?</h4>
        
        <p>
        This is a tool to help guide the search process, but doesn't replace your 
        clinical and case management expertise in <br>
        assisting a person with finding housing or placement. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Use the text search and/or filters to build a list of placements that 
        seem suitable for your patient. Add these placements to your cart and 
        download it into a pre-formatted Excel spreadsheet to use as a note-taking 
        template for making calls. Check the announcements page to see if an 
        opening has been posted recently, and browse the comments to find out 
        additional details that may be relevant to your search. When you're done, come 
        back and post what you've learned to help someone else out!
        </p>

    <h4 class='text-info'>What’s in the database?</h4>

        <p>
        As of the most recent update, 5600A group home placements statewide are 
        available in the database. The information is obtained from the 
        <a href='https://www2.ncdhhs.gov/dhsr/mhlcs/facilities.html'>DHSR licensed 
        facilities listing</a>. Some details have also been pulled from existing CRH 
        “Recommended Placements” documents. Family Care Homes and Adult Care Homes are 
        in the process of being added, and updates are consistently made based on 
        information contributed by social workers.
        </p>

        <p>
        The administrator will also update existing information based on comments and 
        announcements made by users like you. When you learn a new piece of information 
        about a placement or licensee, please notify the administrator via one of the 
        methods described below. 
        </p>

    <h4 class='text-info'>How do I add my updates to the site?</h4>

        <p>
        You can add comments about individual placements by navigating to the page 
        for that placement and scrolling down to the comments section. Especially 
        helpful would be the gender served at the facility, and the contact person for 
        referrals along with their phone/fax numbers (especially if this is different 
        than what is listed on the page). Consider other info like special funding 
        needed, specific age range or diagnosis, HUD or other application types, or 
        special populations that will/will not be considered (sex offenders, legal 
        background). 
        </p>
    
        <p>
        You can also make announcements about bed openings or other time-sensitive 
        matters on the Announcements page. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
        If you’ve used a downloaded spreadsheet to take notes and have logged bits of 
        info about a lot of placements which would be tedious to go back and add 
        individual comments about, feel free to email your spreadsheet to Lauren 
        Sheridan and she will happily add your information to the database during the 
        next round of updates. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
        Thank you in advance for giving back to your fellow SWs by adding updated info 
        to the site! 
        </p>
        
    <h4 class='text-info'>Is this site secure?</h4>

        <p>
        The website is secured using a variety of methods including

        Users cannot self-register, they can only be added by an administrator. The site 
        is only accessible by CRH social workers who have requested credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
        The site is not <a 
        href="https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/laws-regulations/index.html">
            HIPAA-compliant</a> and therefore should not contain any PHI. The administrator
        reviews and removes any PHI as well as content that may be considered unprofessional 
        or disrespectful.
